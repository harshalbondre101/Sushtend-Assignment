## Usage Example

Transcript Input:

Customer: Hi, I tried booking a slot yesterday for your service, but the payment failed.
Agent: Iâ€™m sorry to hear that. Did you receive any error message?
Customer: Yes, it said "transaction declined" even though my card works elsewhere.
Agent: I understand. Iâ€™ll escalate this to our billing team and ensure your slot is reserved.
Customer: Thanks, I was really frustrated because I needed it urgently.


Output:

Summary: A customer attempted to book a service but the payment failed. The agent promised to escalate the issue and reserve the slot.

Sentiment: Negative
